Last Updated: July 5, 2024

INTRODUCTION
This Agreement applies to any individual person or entity (“You”, “Your” or “Licensee”) that uses or distributes any portion or element of the Stability AI Materials or Derivative Works thereof for any Research & Non-Commercial or Commercial purpose. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section V below.

This Agreement is intended to allow research, non-commercial, and limited commercial uses of the Models free of charge. In order to ensure that certain limited commercial uses of the Models continue to be allowed, this Agreement preserves free access to the Models for people or organizations generating annual revenue of less than US $1,000,000 (or local currency equivalent).

By clicking “I Accept” or by using or distributing or using any portion or element of the Stability Materials or Derivative Works, You agree that You have read, understood and are bound by the terms of this Agreement. If You are acting on behalf of a company, organization or other entity, then “You” includes you and that entity, and You agree that You: (i) are an authorized representative of such entity with the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, and (ii) You agree to the terms of this Agreement on that entity’s behalf.

RESEARCH & NON-COMMERCIAL USE LICENSE
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Stability AI grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable and royalty-free limited license under Stability AI’s intellectual property or other rights owned by Stability AI embodied in the Stability AI Materials to use, reproduce, distribute, and create Derivative Works of, and make modifications to, the Stability AI Materials for any Research or Non-Commercial Purpose. “Research Purpose” means academic or scientific advancement, and in each case, is not primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation to You or others. “Non-Commercial Purpose” means any purpose other than a Research Purpose that is not primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation to You or others, such as personal use (i.e., hobbyist) or evaluation and testing.

COMMERCIAL USE LICENSE
Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the remainder of this Section III), Stability AI grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable and royalty-free limited license under Stability AI’s intellectual property or other rights owned by Stability AI embodied in the Stability AI Materials to use, reproduce, distribute, and create Derivative Works of, and make modifications to, the Stability AI Materials for any Commercial Purpose. “Commercial Purpose” means any purpose other than a Research Purpose or Non-Commercial Purpose that is primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation to You or others, including but not limited to, (i) creating, modifying, or distributing Your product or service, including via a hosted service or application programming interface, and (ii) for Your business’s or organization’s internal operations.

If at any time You or Your Affiliate(s), either individually or in aggregate, generate more than USD $1,000,000 in annual revenue (or the equivalent thereof in Your local currency), regardless of whether that revenue is generated directly or indirectly from the Stability AI Materials or Derivative Works, any licenses granted to You under this Agreement shall terminate as of such date. You must request a license from Stability AI at (https://stability.ai/enterprise) , which Stability AI may grant to You in its sole discretion. If you receive Stability AI Materials, or any Derivative Works thereof, from a Licensee as part of an integrated end user product, then Section III of this Agreement will not apply to you.
